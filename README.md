## To run the program

- Simply type `npm start` in the terminal.

***OR***

- You can directly use the application in this link: https://demos.constraintmodelling.org/university-timetabling/
- **DO NOT REFRESH ON THE PAGE ABOVE**: This will cause 404 error
  - This is because, the webpage is hosted via ngnix but also the application used react-router/
    - The combination above causes 404 error when the user refreshes the page
    - This error colud be fixed, but I have to change the back-end code which I do not have the access.
